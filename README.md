## Backend Setup & Database Connection

### **1. Image Storage Strategy**

*   **Correct:** Your strategy is a standard and secure practice.
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Temporary Local Storage:** Use **Multer** to accept the file upload and save it *temporarily* to a folder on your server (e.g., `./public/temp`). This provides a buffer.
    2.  **Permanent Cloud Storage:** Use a service like **Cloudinary** to upload the file from your local temp folder to their secure, scalable cloud storage.
    3.  **Cleanup:** After a successful upload to Cloudinary, **immediately delete the file from your local server** using `fs.unlink()`. This prevents your server's disk from filling up.
*   **Why?** This two-step process ensures that if the upload to Cloudinary fails (due to a network error, invalid file, etc.), you haven't lost the original file‚Äîit's still in your temp folder and the request can be retried. It decouples the receipt of the file from its permanent storage.

---

### **2. Project Initialization & `.gitignore`**

*   **Initialize Project:** Run `npm init -y` in your project root.
*   **.gitignore:** A **`gitignore` generator for Node.js** is an excellent tool. It automatically creates a `.gitignore` file that excludes:
    *   `node_modules/` (dependencies, can be reinstalled with `npm install`)
    *   `.env` (environment variables containing secrets like API keys)
    *   Log files, runtime files, and OS-specific files (e.g., `.DS_Store`).
*   **Example `.gitignore` content:**
    ```gitignore
    # Dependencies
    node_modules/
    /node_modules

    # Environment variables
    .env
    .env.local
    .env.development.local
    .env.test.local
    .env.production.local

    # Logs
    npm-debug.log*
    yarn-debug.log*
    yarn-error.log*
    lerna-debug.log*

    # Runtime data
    pids
    *.pid
    *.seed
    *.pid.lock

    # Optional npm cache directory
    .npm

    # Optional eslint cache
    .eslintcache

    # Mac
    .DS_Store

    # Windows
    Thumbs.db

    # IDE
    .vscode/
    .idea/

    # Temporary folders
    /public/temp
    tmp/
    temp/
    ```

---

### **3. Development Dependencies & Tools**

*   **`nodemon`:** Installed as a *development dependency* (`-D` flag) because it's only needed during development to automatically restart the server when files change.
    ```bash
    npm install -D nodemon
    ```
*   **`prettier`:** A code formatter. It needs project-specific configuration, usually defined in a `.prettierrc` file in the project root.
    ```json
    // .prettierrc
    {
      "semi": true,
      "singleQuote": true,
      "tabWidth": 2
    }
    ```

---

### **4. Project Structure (`/src`)**

A well-organized `src` folder is crucial for maintainability.

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ constants.js         # Application constants (status codes, messages)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.js              # Express app configuration (middleware, routes)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ server.js           # Entry point: connects to DB & starts the server
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ controllers/        # Functions that handle the logic for each route
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models/             # Mongoose schemas and models
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ routes/             # Route definitions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ middlewares/        # Custom middleware (auth, error handling, upload)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/              # Helper functions (ApiResponse, ApiError, asyncHandler, cloudinary.js)
```

---

### **5. Database Connection with Mongoose & Debugging**

**a) Packages to Install:**
```bash
npm install express mongoose dotenv
```

**b) Database Connection Utility (`db/index.js`):**
```javascript
// src/db/index.js
import mongoose from 'mongoose';

const connectDB = async () => {
    try {
        const connectionInstance = await mongoose.connect(
            `${process.env.MONGODB_URI}/${process.env.DB_NAME}`
        );
        console.log(`\n‚úÖ MongoDB connected !! DB HOST: ${connectionInstance.connection.host}`);

    } catch (error) {
        console.error("‚ùå MONGODB connection FAILED: ", error);
        process.exit(1); // Exit the process with failure (1)
    }
};

export default connectDB;
```

**c) The Main Server File (`server.js`):**
This is the application's entry point.
```javascript
// src/server.js
// The flag `-r dotenv/config` in the package.json script pre-loads dotenv.
// No need to require it here if using that flag.
import { app } from './app.js';
import connectDB from './db/index.js';

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 8000;

// Connect to Database first, then start the server
connectDB()
    .then(() => {
        // .on() is an event listener for the 'error' event
        app.on("error", (error) => {
            console.error("‚ùå Express server error: ", error);
            throw error;
        });

        app.listen(PORT, () => {
            console.log(`üü¢ Server is running on port: ${PORT}`);
        });
    })
    .catch((err) => {
        console.error("‚ùå MongoDB connection failed. Server did not start.", err);
    });
```

**d) Environment Variables (`.env`):**
Create a `.env` file in your project root (and add it to `.gitignore`).
```bash
# Server
PORT=8000
NODE_ENV=development

# Database
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.abc123.mongodb.net
DB_NAME=your_database_name

# Cloudinary
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret

# CORS
CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000
# OR for multiple origins (comma-separated)
# CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000,https://myapp.vercel.app
```

**e) Package.json Scripts:**
The `--experimental-json-modules` flag allows you to use `import/export` syntax in your Node.js files without converting them to `.mjs`.
```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "nodemon -r dotenv/config --experimental-json-modules src/server.js",
  "start": "node -r dotenv/config --experimental-json-modules src/server.js"
}
```

---

### **Debugging the Connection**

1.  **Check Your MongoDB Atlas URI:**
    *   Format: `mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.abc123.mongodb.net/`
    *   Ensure your IP is whitelisted in the Atlas Network Access panel (or allow access from anywhere `0.0.0.0/0` for development).
    *   Ensure the database user exists and has the correct privileges.

2.  **Check Environment Variables:**
    *   Is your `.env` file in the correct location (project root)?
    *   Are the variable names in `.env` exactly matching those in your code (e.g., `process.env.MONGODB_URI`)?

3.  **Enable Mongoose Debugging:** Add this line *after* your imports in your DB connection file to see all Mongoose queries executed in the console. This is incredibly helpful for debugging.
    ```javascript
    // src/db/index.js
    import mongoose from 'mongoose';
    mongoose.set('debug', true); // <-- Add this line
    const connectDB = async () => { ... };
    ```

4.  **Check the Console:** The error logs from the `catch` block and `app.on("error")` will provide specific reasons for failures (e.g., "Authentication failed", "Network timeout").


---

## Custom API Response & Error Handling

### **1. Required Packages & Their Purpose**

*   **`cookie-parser`:** A middleware that parses cookies attached to the client's request object. It populates `req.cookies` with an object keyed by the cookie names.
*   **`cors`:** Middleware to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS). It allows you to make requests from a frontend application (on a different domain/port) to your backend API by setting the necessary HTTP headers.

---

### **2. Express Request Object (`req`) Properties**

Understanding where data comes from is crucial:

*   **`req.params`:** Contains route parameters (e.g., for a route like `/users/:id`, accessing `/users/123` will give `req.params = { id: '123' }`).
*   **`req.body`:** Contains data from the request body. **This is only populated if you use a body-parsing middleware** like `express.json()`. It holds data from forms, JSON payloads, and (when combined with Multer) text fields from file uploads.
*   **`req.cookies`:** Contains cookies sent by the client. **This is only populated if you use the `cookie-parser` middleware.** If no cookies are sent, it defaults to an empty object `{}`.
*   **`req.query`:** Contains the query string parameters (e.g., for a URL like `/users?name=John&age=30`, `req.query` will be `{ name: 'John', age: '30' }`).
*   **`req.file` / `req.files`:** Contains information about the uploaded file(s). **This is populated by the `multer` middleware.**

---

### **3. Middleware Configuration with `app.use()`**

`app.use()` is used to mount middleware functions and configuration settings for your Express application. Middleware functions are executed sequentially in the order they are defined.

**Essential Security & Configuration Middleware:**

```javascript
// app.js or index.js
import express from 'express';
import cors from 'cors';
import cookieParser from 'cookie-parser';

const app = express();

// 1. CORS Configuration (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)
app.use(cors({
    origin: process.env.CORS_ORIGIN, // e.g., "https://yourfrontendapp.vercel.app" or "http://localhost:3000"
    credentials: true // Allows the frontend to send cookies/credentials
}));

// 2. Body Parsing Middleware
// For data coming from JSON payloads
app.use(express.json({ limit: "16kb" }));

// For data coming from HTML forms (e.g., <form action="..." method="post">)
// The `extended: true` option allows parsing rich objects and arrays encoded in the URL-encoded format.
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true, limit: "16kb" }));

// 3. Serve Static Files
// This makes files in the './public' directory (like images, CSS, PDFs) publicly accessible.
// Example: A file at './public/images/avatar.jpg' can be accessed via '/images/avatar.jpg'.
app.use(express.static("public"));

// 4. Cookie Parser Middleware
// Parses incoming cookies from the request and makes them available in `req.cookies`.
app.use(cookieParser());

// ... Your routes go here (e.g., app.use("/api/v1/users", userRouter))

// ... Your global error handling middleware goes at the end
export { app };
```

**CORS Whitelisting:** Instead of a single origin, you can pass an array of whitelisted origins or a function for dynamic checks.
```javascript
origin: function (origin, callback) {
  if (whitelist.indexOf(origin) !== -1 || !origin) {
    callback(null, true);
  } else {
    callback(new Error('Not allowed by CORS'));
  }
}
```

---

### **4. Building a Custom Utility: `asyncHandler`**

Wrapping async route handlers to avoid repetitive `try...catch` blocks.

```javascript
// utils/asyncHandler.js
const asyncHandler = (requestHandler) => {
    return (req, res, next) => {
        // Promise.resolve() takes the function and resolves it.
        // If it throws an error or rejects, the `.catch()` passes it to `next`.
        Promise.resolve(requestHandler(req, res, next)).catch(next);
    };
};

export { asyncHandler };

// Usage in a controller
// import { asyncHandler } from "../utils/asyncHandler.js";
// const registerUser = asyncHandler(async (req, res) => { ... });
```

---

### **5. Standardizing API Responses & Errors**

Creating custom classes for consistent API response and error structures is a best practice.

**a) Custom API Response Class:**
```javascript
// utils/ApiResponse.js
class ApiResponse {
    constructor(statusCode, data, message = "Success") {
        this.statusCode = statusCode;
        this.data = data;
        this.message = message;
        this.success = statusCode < 400; // HTTP status codes less than 400 are successes
    }
}

export { ApiResponse };

// Usage in a controller:
// return res.status(200).json(new ApiResponse(200, user, "User registered successfully"));
```

**b) Custom API Error Class (Extending the built-in `Error`):**
```javascript
// utils/ApiError.js
class ApiError extends Error {
    constructor(
        statusCode,
        message = "Something went wrong",
        errors = [],
        stack = ""
    ) {
        super(message); // Calls the parent Error constructor
        this.statusCode = statusCode;
        this.data = null;
        this.message = message;
        this.success = false;
        this.errors = errors; // Can be used for validation errors

        // Capture the stack trace for better debugging
        if (stack) {
            this.stack = stack;
        } else {
            Error.captureStackTrace(this, this.constructor);
        }
    }
}

export { ApiError };

// Usage:
// throw new ApiError(404, "User not found");
// throw new ApiError(400, "Validation failed", validationErrorsArray);
```

---

### **6. Global Error Handling Middleware**

This is the final middleware in your chain. It catches any errors passed via `next(error)` and sends a standardized, secure JSON error response.

```javascript
// middleware/error.middleware.js
const errorHandler = (err, req, res, next) => {
    let error = err;

    // If the error is not already an instance of ApiError, create a generic one
    if (!(error instanceof ApiError)) {
        const statusCode = error.statusCode || 500;
        const message = error.message || "Internal Server Error";
        error = new ApiError(statusCode, message, error?.errors, error?.stack);
    }

    // Prepare the error response
    const response = {
        ...error,
        message: error.message,
        ...(process.env.NODE_ENV === "development" ? { stack: error.stack } : {}), // Send stack trace only in development
    };

    // Log the error for debugging
    console.error(`[Error] ${error.message}`);

    // Send the JSON response
    return res.status(error.statusCode).json(response);
};

export { errorHandler };
```

**Usage in `app.js`:**
```javascript
// ... after all your routes
import { errorHandler } from './middleware/error.middleware.js';
app.use(errorHandler); // This MUST be the last middleware
```

### **Summary of Corrections & Highlights**

1.  **`req.query`:** Added this important property for handling URL query parameters.
2.  **`express.urlencoded`:** Clarified that `extended: true` allows for parsing rich objects and arrays, not just "object inside object."
3.  **`express.static`:** Corrected the explanation. It serves files *from* the specified folder (e.g., `public`) *to* the client, making them publicly accessible.
4.  **Middleware Order:** Emphasized that the order of `app.use()` calls is critical. Error handling middleware must come last.
5.  **Error Handling:** The provided `ApiError` class and global error handler offer a much more robust and standard solution than simply "overriding methods." This is the industry-standard pattern.
6.  **Security:** The global error handler explicitly avoids sending the stack trace in production mode, which is a crucial security practice to avoid leaking sensitive implementation details.

## User & Video Models with Hooks and JWT: A Structured Guide

### **1. Database and Models**

*   **MongoDB & BSON:** MongoDB stores data in a binary-encoded format called **BSON** (Binary JSON). Each document automatically gets a unique `_id` field of type `ObjectId`, which is a primary key stored in this BSON format.

*   **Indexing (`index: true`):**
    *   **Correct:** Adding an index on a frequently queried field (like `user.name`) is an **expensive operation *on write* (insert/update/delete)** because the database must maintain the index structure.
    *   **Benefit:** It makes **read operations (searching, filtering, sorting) extremely efficient** by allowing the database to quickly locate data without performing a "collection scan" (checking every single document).
    *   **Verdict:** The trade-off is almost always worth it for fields used in search queries. The write performance cost is minimal compared to the massive read performance gain.

*   **Mongoose Aggregation Paginate (`mongoose-aggregate-paginate-v2`):**
    *   **Purpose:** This plugin is a powerful tool for adding pagination to the results of **MongoDB aggregation pipelines**. Aggregation is used for complex data processing, transformation, and computation.
    *   **Functionality:** Instead of getting a single, large result set from an aggregation query (e.g., "get all users who bought a product in the last year, with their total spend"), this plugin allows you to split the results into manageable pages with metadata like `totalDocs`, `totalPages`, `nextPage`, etc.
    *   **Use Case:** Essential for building efficient and user-friendly APIs that return large, complex datasets (e.g., analytics dashboards, admin panels, activity feeds).

---

### **2. Password Hashing with `bcryptjs`**

*   **`bcrypt` vs. `bcryptjs`:**
    *   **`bcrypt`:** A popular npm module that relies on native C++ bindings (the `node-gyp` build tool). It's very fast.
    *   **`bcryptjs`:** A pure JavaScript implementation of the bcrypt algorithm. Its key advantages are:
        1.  **Zero Dependencies:** Makes your project dependency tree simpler and more secure.
        2.  **Portability:** Works anywhere JavaScript runs, without the need for a compiler (`node-gyp`), which can be problematic on some Windows machines or CI/CD environments.
    *   **Verdict:** Both are excellent. `bcryptjs` is often chosen for its ease of installation and compatibility. They produce hashes that are interoperable.

*   **How it Works:** The library automatically generates a **salt** (a random value) and combines it with the password before hashing. This protects against rainbow table attacks. The resulting hash string includes the salt, the cost factor (work factor), and the final hash.

---

### **3. Mongoose Middleware (Hooks)**

*   **Purpose:** Hooks allow you to inject custom logic at specific points in the lifecycle of a Mongoose document (like a User or Video document).
*   **Common Hooks:** `pre('save')`, `pre('findOneAndUpdate')`, `post('save')`, `pre('remove')`, etc.
*   **Classic Use Case - Password Hashing:**
    ```javascript
    userSchema.pre('save', async function (next) {
      // Only run this function if the password was modified
      if (!this.isModified('password')) return next();

      // Hash the password with a cost of 12
      this.password = await bcrypt.hash(this.password, 12);
      next();
    });
    ```
*   **‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Note on Arrow Functions:**
    *   **Correct:** Arrow functions do not have their own `this` context; they inherit it from the surrounding scope. In a Mongoose hook, `this` is supposed to be the document being saved.
    *   **Incorrect:** Using an arrow function `pre('save', () => { ... })` would break the code because `this` would not refer to the document. You **must use a traditional function expression** to have the correct `this` binding.

---

### **4. JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**

*   **Concept:** A JWT is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims (user data) to be transferred between two parties. It is a **bearer token**‚Äîwhoever possesses it ("the bearer") can access the associated resources.

*   **Structure (3 parts separated by dots `.`):**
    1.  **Header:** Contains metadata (e.g., `{"alg": "HS256", "typ": "JWT"}`).
    2.  **Payload:** Contains the "claims" or the actual data (e.g., `{"userId": "12345", "username": "john"}`). This data is **encoded** but not encrypted (readable by anyone if decoded).
    3.  **Signature:** Created by hashing the header + payload + a **secret key** (only known by the server). This signature is used to verify that the token hasn't been tampered with.

*   **Session vs. Token (Cookies vs. JWT):** You can use both. JWTs are often stored in the browser's `localStorage` or `sessionStorage` and sent in the `Authorization` header. Alternatively, they can be stored in HTTP-only cookies for better security against XSS attacks. The choice depends on your application's security requirements.

*   **Access Token vs. Refresh Token:**
    *   **Access Token:** Short-lived (e.g., 15 mins). It's sent with every request to access protected resources. It is **not stored in the database**; its validity is checked via its signature.
    *   **Refresh Token:** Long-lived (e.g., 7 days). It is **securely stored in the database** associated with a user. Its only job is to obtain a new Access Token when the old one expires. This architecture is more secure because a compromised Access Token is valid for a very short time.

### **Summary of Key Corrections & Highlights**

1.  **Indexing:** The cost is on **write operations**, not inherently "expensive" in a general sense. The benefit for read performance is crucial.
2.  **`bcryptjs`:** It is a **pure JS** library with **no dependencies**, chosen for portability and simplicity, not because it's "optimized JS" (though it is well-optimized).
3.  **`this` in Hooks:** The point about arrow functions is critical. Using them in Mongoose hooks is a common bug. **Always use a traditional `function`** for Mongoose middleware to get the correct document context.
4.  **JWT Storage:** Clarified the critical security pattern: **Access Tokens (short-lived, not in DB)** vs. **Refresh Tokens (long-lived, stored in DB)**. This is a fundamental concept for secure JWT implementation.

Of course. Here is a structured and detailed guide on handling file uploads in a Node.js backend using Multer and Cloudinary, following the format of the previous explanations.

## How to Upload Files in Backend | Multer & Cloudinary

### **Overview: The Two-Step Process**

Handling file uploads securely and efficiently typically involves a two-step process:
1.  **Temporary Local Storage:** Receive the file from the client and store it temporarily on your server's filesystem. This step is handled by the **Multer** middleware.
2.  **Permanent Cloud Storage:** Upload the file from the temporary local storage to a dedicated cloud storage service (like **Cloudinary**). After a successful upload, you clean up the local file.

Using a third-party service like Cloudinary is crucial for production applications. It manages file optimization (resizing, compression, format conversion), delivery via a global CDN, and storage, freeing your application from these resource-intensive tasks.

---

### **Key Packages & Technologies**

1.  **Multer:** A Node.js middleware designed specifically for handling `multipart/form-data` (the encoding type used for file uploads). It extracts the file from the request and gives you control over saving it to disk or memory.
2.  **Cloudinary SDK:** The official Node.js library provided by Cloudinary. It provides simple methods to upload, manage, and transform images and videos directly from your code.
3.  **`fs` (File System) Module:** A core Node.js module. You will use its `promises` version (`fs.promises`) for modern, promise-based operations like reading, writing, and **deleting (unlinking)** files from your server's local storage.

---

### **Step 1: Create the Multer Middleware**

Multer is used to get the file from the HTTP request and save it to a temporary folder on your server.

**Configuration:**
```javascript
// utils/multer.middleware.js
import multer from 'multer';

// Configure storage location and filename
const storage = multer.diskStorage({
  destination: function (req, file, cb) {
    cb(null, './public/temp') // Temporary folder path
  },
  filename: function (req, file, cb) {
    // Create a unique filename to avoid conflicts
    const uniqueSuffix = Date.now() + '-' + Math.round(Math.random() * 1E9)
    cb(null, file.fieldname + '-' + uniqueSuffix)
  }
})

export const upload = multer({ 
  storage: storage,
  // You can add limits and fileFilter here for security
  // limits: { fileSize: 5 * 1024 * 1024 }, // 5MB limit
  // fileFilter: (req, file, cb) => { ... } // Allow only images/videos
})
```

**Usage in Route:**
Apply the middleware to the specific route that handles uploads. `upload.single('avatar')` expects a form field named `avatar` containing the file.
```javascript
// routes/user.routes.js
import express from 'express';
import { upload } from '../utils/multer.middleware.js';
import { registerUser } from '../controllers/user.controller.js';

const router = express.Router();

router.route("/register").post(
  upload.single('avatar'), // Middleware to handle single file upload
  registerUser
);

export default router;
```
**After this step,** the file is saved in `./public/temp`. Its information is available in `req.file` (for `upload.single`) inside your controller.

---

### **Step 2: Upload to Cloudinary and Clean Up**

This logic is best placed in a **utility/helper function** or directly within your controller. The flow is:
1.  Get the local path of the file from `req.file.path`.
2.  Use the Cloudinary SDK to upload this file.
3.  If successful, delete the local file using `fs.promises.unlink()`.
4.  Save the secure URL returned by Cloudinary to your database (e.g., the User or Video model).

**Cloudinary Utility Function:**
```javascript
// utils/cloudinary.js
import { v2 as cloudinary } from 'cloudinary';
import fs from 'fs/promises'; // For promise-based file operations

// Configure Cloudinary with your credentials
cloudinary.config({ 
  cloud_name: process.env.CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME, 
  api_key: process.env.CLOUDINARY_API_KEY, 
  api_secret: process.env.CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET 
});

const uploadOnCloudinary = async (localFilePath) => {
  try {
    if (!localFilePath) {
      console.log("Local file path is missing.");
      return null;
    }
    // Upload the file to Cloudinary in the 'my_folder' directory
    const response = await cloudinary.uploader.upload(localFilePath, {
      resource_type: "auto",
      folder: "my_folder" // Optional: Organize files in folders on Cloudinary
    });

    // File has been uploaded successfully
    console.log("File uploaded on Cloudinary: ", response.url);

    // Remove the locally saved temporary file
    await fs.unlink(localFilePath);
    console.log("Temporary file deleted: ", localFilePath);

    return response; // This object contains URL, public_id, etc.

  } catch (error) {
    // If upload fails, remove the locally saved temporary file
    if (localFilePath) {
      await fs.unlink(localFilePath).catch(cleanupError => {
        console.error("Failed to delete temporary file during cleanup:", cleanupError);
      });
    }
    console.error("Cloudinary upload failed:", error);
    return null;
  }
};

export { uploadOnCloudinary };
```

**Usage in Controller:**
```javascript
// controllers/user.controller.js
import { uploadOnCloudinary } from '../utils/cloudinary.js';

const registerUser = async (req, res) => {
  try {
    // 1. Get data from req.body
    // 2. Validation

    // 3. Check if avatar file is uploaded (via Multer)
    const avatarLocalPath = req.file?.path;

    if (!avatarLocalPath) {
      throw new ApiError(400, "Avatar file is required");
    }

    // 4. Upload avatar to Cloudinary
    const avatar = await uploadOnCloudinary(avatarLocalPath);

    if (!avatar) {
      throw new ApiError(500, "Failed to upload avatar");
    }

    // 5. Create user object and save to database
    const user = await User.create({
      username: req.body.username,
      email: req.body.email,
      avatar: avatar.url, // Save the secure URL from Cloudinary
      // ... other fields
    });

    // 6. Return response
    return res.status(201).json(new ApiResponse(201, user, "User registered successfully"));

  } catch (error) {
    // Handle errors
  }
};
```

### **Summary of Key Points**

*   **Why Two Steps?** Multer handles the initial receipt of the file from the HTTP request. Cloudinary handles permanent, optimized, and scalable storage. The local filesystem is only a temporary holding area.
*   **`fs.unlink()`:** This is the correct method to **delete (remove)** a file from the local filesystem. The term "unlink" is a legacy from Unix/POSIX systems, where it means removing a filesystem link to a file. Once all links are removed, the file's data is marked for deletion by the operating system.
*   **Security & Cleanup:** Always clean up temporary files, both on success *and* failure. Leaving themÂ†ÜÁßØ (piling up) wastes disk space and is a poor practice.
*   **Customization:** The provided code is a template. You should add validation (check file type, size), error handling, and configure Cloudinary upload options (folder, transformation) as needed for your application.

## HTTP Crash Course: Methods & Headers

### **Overview: HTTP vs. HTTPS**

The core difference lies in security and data transmission.

*   **HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol):**
    *   The foundational protocol of the web for transmitting data between a client and a server.
    *   **Major Drawback:** Data is sent in **plain text (clear format)**. Anyone intercepting the communication (e.g., on a public Wi-Fi network) can read the information being exchanged, including passwords and credit card numbers.
    *   **Default Port:** 80

*   **HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure):**
    *   This is HTTP with a critical security layer added on top.
    *   It uses **TLS/SSL (Transport Layer Security/Secure Sockets Layer)** to encrypt all communication between the client and server.
    *   **Benefit:** The data in transit is in an **unreadable, encrypted format**. It can only be decrypted and read by the intended client and server using a secret key.
    *   **Underlying Knowledge:** Implementing HTTPS involves concepts from **cryptography** (encryption algorithms), **networking** (secure data transfer), and **operating systems** (secure storage and processing of keys).
    *   **Default Port:** 443

**Key Takeaway:** Always use HTTPS for any website, especially those handling sensitive user data.

---

### **The Client-Server Model**

HTTP is a stateless client-server protocol.
*   **Client:** The application (e.g., a web browser like Chrome, a mobile app) that initiates a request to a server.
*   **Server:** The application that receives the request, processes it, and sends back a response (e.g., a web page, API data).

---

### **URL, URI, URN**

*   **URI (Uniform Resource Identifier):** A broad term for any string that identifies a resource. It is the **umbrella category**.
*   **URL (Uniform Resource Locator):** The most common type of URI. It not only identifies a resource but also provides the means to **locate** it (its network "address").
    *   **Example:** `https://www.example.com/products/index.html`
    *   It includes the protocol (`https`), domain (`www.example.com`), and path (`/products/index.html`).
*   **URN (Uniform Resource Name):** A type of URI that is intended to be a unique, persistent, and location-independent name for a resource. (e.g., `urn:isbn:0451450523` to identify a book by its ISBN number).

**In simple terms:** All URLs are URIs, but not all URIs are URLs. URNs are a specific type of URI meant for naming, not locating.

---

## **What are HTTP Headers?**

HTTP headers are the core mechanism for sending additional **metadata** (data about data) between a client and a server alongside an HTTP request or response.

*   **Structure:** They are simple **key-value** pairs (e.g., `Content-Type: application/json`).
*   **Standardization:** Many headers are officially defined by RFCs, but you can also define your own **custom headers** (usually prefixed with `X-`, e.g., `X-Custom-API-Key`).
*   **Direction:** Headers are present in both **requests** (from client) and **responses** (from server).

---

### **Key Functions of Headers**

Headers serve several critical purposes:
1.  **Caching:** Control how responses are stored and reused (e.g., `Cache-Control`, `Expires`).
2.  **Authentication:** Provide credentials to prove identity.
    *   **Bearer Token:** `Authorization: Bearer <token_string>`
    *   **Session Cookies:** `Cookie: session_id=abc123`
3.  **State Management:** HTTP is stateless, but headers like `Cookie` and `Set-Cookie` allow servers to maintain state across requests, tracking if a **user is logged in** or is a **guest user**.
4.  **Content Negotiation:** The client and server agree on the best representation of a resource (e.g., `Accept: application/json` tells the server the client prefers JSON data).
5.  **Message Body Information:** Describe the content of the body (e.g., `Content-Type: text/html`, `Content-Length: 1024`).

---

### **Categories of Headers**

*   **Request Headers:** Sent by the client to the server. Provide information about the request, the client itself, and required responses.
    *   *Examples:* `User-Agent`, `Accept`, `Authorization`, `Cookie`.
*   **Response Headers:** Sent by the server to the client. Provide information about the response and the server.
    *   *Examples:* `Server`, `Set-Cookie`, `Cache-Control`.
*   **Representation Headers:** Describe the **original format** of the message body data and any encoding applied to it for transfer. This is crucial for understanding how to decode the data.
    *   *Examples:* `Content-Type`, `Content-Encoding` (e.g., `gzip`, `br` for compression).
*   **Payload Headers:** Contain information about the **payload data** itself, such as its length and location.
    *   *Examples:* `Content-Length`, `Content-Range`.

---

### **Most Common Headers**

| Header | Purpose | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`Accept`** | (Request) Tells the server what media types the client can understand. | `Accept: application/json, text/html` |
| **`User-Agent`** | (Request) Identifies the application/browser/OS making the request. | `User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0...)` |
| **`Authorization`** | (Request) Contains credentials for authenticating the client. | `Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOi...` |
| **`Content-Type`** | (Entity) Indicates the media type of the resource being sent. | `Content-Type: application/json` |
| **`Cookie`** | (Request) Sends stored cookies back to the server. | `Cookie: sessionId=38afes7a` |
| **`Set-Cookie`** | (Response) Sends cookies from the server to be stored by the client. | `Set-Cookie: sessionId=38afes7a; Path=/` |
| **`Cache-Control`** | (Response) Directives for caching mechanisms. | `Cache-Control: max-age=3600` |

---

### **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) Headers**

CORS is a security mechanism enforced by browsers. It uses headers to allow a web application running at one **origin** (domain) to access resources from a server at a different origin.

*   **`Access-Control-Allow-Origin`**: (Response) Specifies which origins are permitted to access the resource. `*` allows any origin.
*   **`Access-Control-Allow-Credentials`**: (Response) Indicates whether the response to the request can be exposed when the credentials flag (like cookies) is true.
*   **`Access-Control-Allow-Methods`**: (Response) Specifies the HTTP methods (e.g., GET, POST, PUT) allowed when accessing the resource in response to a preflight request.

---

### **Security Headers**

These headers are crucial for hardening a website against common attacks. They must be configured on the server.

*   **`Content-Security-Policy` (CSP)**: A powerful header that prevents a wide range of attacks, especially Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), by defining approved sources of content (scripts, styles, images, etc.) that the browser is allowed to load.
*   **`X-XSS-Protection`**: (Legacy) Filters pages if a reflected XSS attack is detected. Modern browsers rely more on CSP, but it can still be used for older browser support.
*   **`Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy` (COEP)**: Helps prevent a document from loading any cross-origin resources that don‚Äôt explicitly grant permission.
*   **`Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy` (COOP)**: Isolates a browsing context from other documents, preventing them from interacting with it, which helps mitigate speculative side-channel attacks like Spectre.

Of course. Here is a structured and detailed breakdown of HTTP Methods and Status Codes, correcting and expanding on the information you provided.

---

## HTTP Methods (Verbs)

HTTP methods define the primary operation a client wants to perform on a resource identified by a URL. They are the core of RESTful API design.

| Method | Purpose & Semantics | Idempotent? | Safe? |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: |
| **`GET`** | **Retrieve** a representation of a resource. Should not change the server's state. | Yes | Yes |
| **`POST`** | **Create** a new resource or **submit data** to a resource for processing. The most flexible method. | No | No |
| **`PUT`** | **Replace** the target resource entirely with the request payload. Used for full updates. If the resource doesn't exist, it may be created. | Yes | No |
| **`PATCH`** | **Apply a partial modification** to a resource. Used for partial updates. | No | No |
| **`DELETE`** | **Remove** the specified resource. | Yes | No |
| **`HEAD`** | Identical to `GET`, but the server **must not return a message body**. Only the headers are returned. Used to check if a resource exists or to inspect its headers. | Yes | Yes |
| **`OPTIONS`** | Describe the **communication options** (allowed methods, CORS) for the target resource. | Yes | Yes |
| **`TRACE`** | Performs a **message loop-back test** along the path to the target resource. It's used for debugging, as the response will contain the exact request message as received by the final server. **‚ö†Ô∏è Security Note:** This method is often disabled on servers as it can be used for XST (Cross-Site Tracing) attacks. | Yes | Yes |

### Key Concepts:
*   **Idempotent:** Making multiple **identical** requests has the same effect as making a single request. (`GET`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, `HEAD`, `OPTIONS` are idempotent). For example, calling `DELETE /api/users/123` ten times has the same effect as calling it once (the user is still gone).
*   **Safe:** A method is safe if it does **not alter the state** of the server (`GET`, `HEAD`, `OPTIONS`). They are used for read-only operations.

---

## HTTP Status Codes

Status codes are standardized three-digit numbers sent by a server to indicate the result of a client's request. They are grouped by their first digit.

### 1xx - Informational
*   **Provisional response.** The request was received, and the process is continuing.

| Code | Message | Meaning |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **100** | Continue | The client should continue with its request. |
| **102** | Processing | The server has received the request and is processing it, but no response is available yet. |

### 2xx - Success
*   **The action was successfully received, understood, and accepted.**

| Code | Message | Meaning & Common Use Case |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **200** | OK | The standard success response for `GET`, `PUT`, or `PATCH` requests. |
| **201** | Created | The request has been fulfilled, resulting in the **creation of a new resource** (typically after a `POST` request). The response should include a `Location` header pointing to the new resource. |
| **202** | Accepted | The request has been accepted for processing, but the processing is **not complete**. (e.g., queued for background processing). |
| **204** | No Content | The server successfully processed the request but is **not returning any content** (common for `DELETE` requests or successful `POST` requests that don't need a response body). |

### 3xx - Redirection
*   **The client must take additional action to complete the request.**

| Code | Message | Meaning & Common Use Case |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **301** | Moved Permanently | The resource has been assigned a **new permanent URI**. Future references should use the new URI. |
| **302** | Found | The resource is **temporarily** located at a different URI. The client should continue to use the original URI for future requests. |
| **307** | Temporary Redirect | Similar to 302, but **guarantees the method and body will not change** when the redirected request is made. |
| **308** | Permanent Redirect | Similar to 301, but **guarantees the method and body will not change**. |

### 4xx - Client Error
*   **The request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled.** The error is on the client's side.

| Code | Message | Meaning & Common Use Case |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **400** | Bad Request | The server cannot process the request due to **malformed syntax** (e.g., invalid JSON). |
| **401** | Unauthorized | The request requires **user authentication**. The client must identify itself. (e.g., missing or invalid token). |
| **403** | Forbidden | The server understood the request but **refuses to authorize it**. The client's identity is known but doesn't have access. |
| **404** | Not Found | The server **cannot find the requested resource**. This is often used to avoid revealing whether a resource exists for security reasons. |
| **408** | Request Timeout | The server timed out waiting for the request from the client. |
| **429** | Too Many Requests | The user has sent **too many requests** in a given amount of time ("rate limiting"). |

### 5xx - Server Error
*   **The server failed to fulfill a valid request.** The error is on the server's side.

| Code | Message | Meaning & Common Use Case |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **500** | Internal Server Error | A **generic error message** when the server encounters an unexpected condition. |
| **502** | Bad Gateway | The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, received an **invalid response** from an upstream server. |
| **503** | Service Unavailable | The server is **not ready to handle the request** (e.g., down for maintenance, overloaded). |
| **504** | Gateway Timeout | The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, did not get a response from the upstream server in time. |

---

### Summary of Corrections & Highlights

1.  **`POST` vs. `PUT`:** Clarified the primary intent: `POST` is for **create**, `PUT` is for **replace**.
2.  **`402 Payment Required`:** This is a very rare and highly specific status code, not used in general API development. It was reserved for digital payment systems and is not part of standard error handling. It has been removed from the common list.
3.  **`201 Created`:** Added this crucial status code, which is the proper response for a successful resource creation via `POST` (or sometimes `PUT`).
4.  **`204 No Content`:** Added this important success code for actions that succeed but don't return data.
5.  **`403 Forbidden` vs. `401 Unauthorized`:** Corrected the distinction: `401` is about not being authenticated (who are you?), while `403` is about not having permission (you are known but not allowed).
6.  **Security of `TRACE`:** Added a note that `TRACE` is often disabled due to potential security vulnerabilities.

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.js
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ server.js
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ constants.js
```

## 1. Create Async Handler Middleware

**middleware/asyncHandler.js**
```javascript
const asyncHandler = (fn) => (req, res, next) => {
  Promise.resolve(fn(req, res, next)).catch(next);
};

export default asyncHandler;
```

## 2. Create User Controller

**controllers/user.controller.js**
```javascript
import asyncHandler from "../middleware/asyncHandler.js";

// @desc    Register a new user
// @route   POST /api/v1/users/register
// @access  Public
const registerUser = asyncHandler(async (req, res) => {
  try {
    // Your registration logic here
    const { name, email, password } = req.body;
    
    // Check if user exists
    // Create user
    // Generate token
    // Send response
    
    res.status(201).json({
      success: true,
      message: 'User registered successfully',
      data: {
        id: "user_id",
        name,
        email
        // Don't send password back
      }
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Registration error:', error);
    res.status(500).json({
      success: false,
      message: 'Server error during registration',
      error: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' ? error.message : 'Internal server error'
    });
  }
});

// Other controller methods can be added here

export {
  registerUser,
  // Export other methods as needed
};
```

## 3. Create User Routes

**routes/user.routes.js**
```javascript
import express from 'express';
import { registerUser } from '../controllers/user.controller.js';

const router = express.Router();

router.route('/register').post(registerUser);
// Add other routes as needed

export default router;
```

## 4. Set Up Main Application

**app.js**
```javascript
import express from 'express';
import userRoutes from './routes/user.routes.js';

const app = express();

// Body parser middleware
app.use(express.json());
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));

// API routes - versioned
app.use('/api/v1/users', userRoutes);
// Add other route groups as needed

// Debugging middleware - log all requests
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log(`${new Date().toISOString()} - ${req.method} ${req.originalUrl}`);
  next();
});

// Error handling middleware
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.error(err.stack);
  res.status(500).json({
    success: false,
    message: 'Something went wrong!',
    error: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' ? err.message : 'Internal server error'
  });
});

// 404 handler
app.use('*', (req, res) => {
  res.status(404).json({
    success: false,
    message: `Route ${req.originalUrl} not found`
  });
});

export default app;
```

## 5. Create Server Entry Point

**server.js**
```javascript
import app from './app.js';

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 8000;

app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server running in ${process.env.NODE_ENV || 'development'} mode on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

## API Endpoint Structure
The complete URL will be: `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/users/register`

## Debugging Tips

1. **Enable detailed error messages**:
   ```javascript
   // In your environment setup
   process.env.NODE_ENV = 'development';
   ```

2. **Use console logging strategically**:
   ```javascript
   // In your controller
   console.log('Request body:', req.body);
   console.log('Request params:', req.params);
   console.log('Request query:', req.query);
   ```

3. **Install and use debugging tools**:
   ```bash
   npm install morgan debug
   ```

   **Enhanced app.js with morgan logging**:
   ```javascript
   import morgan from 'morgan';
   
   // Add to app.js after express initialization
   if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
     app.use(morgan('dev'));
   }
   ```

## Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Route not found**: Ensure you're using the correct URL format: `/api/v1/users/register`

2. **Body parser issues**: Make sure you have `app.use(express.json())` before your routes

3. **CORS issues**: Install and use the cors package:
   ```javascript
   import cors from 'cors';
   app.use(cors());
   ```

4. **Async errors**: Our custom asyncHandler ensures all async errors are caught and passed to error middleware

## Running the Application

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install express
   ```

2. Start the server:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

3. Test the endpoint:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name":"John","email":"john@example.com","password":"password123"}' http://localhost:8000/api/v1/users/register
   ```

## Missing/Incorrect Information in Original Request

1. **Missing model implementation**: The original request mentioned models but didn't include implementation
2. **Missing error handling**: Added comprehensive error handling
3. **Missing environment configuration**: Added NODE_ENV usage for different behaviors in development vs production
4. **Missing CORS handling**: Added note about CORS middleware
5. **Missing package.json setup**: Added instructions for installing dependencies

This complete setup provides a robust foundation for building Express applications with proper routing, controllers, and debugging capabilities.



## Logic building | Register controller

logic Building  Register controller

  - get user details from frontend 
  - validation - not empty
  - check if user already exists: username, email
  - check for coverImage, check for avatar(required) in model
  - upload them to cloudinary -->  check img upload in cloudinary
  - create user object -- create entry in db (return all data in response)
  - remove password and refresh token field from response 
  - check for user creation.
  - return response.

{destructure  data  }=req.body
req.url

for files 
  in user.routes.js upload middleware 
  router.rooute('/register').post(
    upload.fields([
      {name:'avatar',
      maxCount:1},
      { name:'coverImage',
      maxCount: 1}
    ])
  );

  User model can directly interact with db
  -  multer middleware gives access to files  : req.files, have multiple properties 
  - req.files.filename-gives-in-multer-middleware[0]?.path
  filename[0] gives 1st property 
  - ? for optional  check

## How to use postman for backend

- have to share Postman collection.
- In req.body need form data, raw json --dont option to send files 
  - content-type
  - value
  - Description



## Access Refresh Token, Middleware and cookies in Backend

if user is authenticated --> access the  resources.
authorization :required some permission to access some resources 

concept of both tokens -- > client have both tokens,
  - access token : 
  - used for validation.
    - fullfill the feature of authentication ,
    - it expired we need to login again using password , 
    - To avoid login again , we use refreshtoken here

  - refresh token : 
    - used to generate new access token.
    - stored in both side , if access token expired, 
    - client send refresh token to server , server check refreshtoken is valid ,
    - if valid and not expired , generate new refresh and access token , and send to the user, 
    and new refresh token save in db.
   -  if invalid or expired, user need to login again, 

// login controller  :: generate tokens and login
-  req.body -> data
    - username or email
    - find the user 
    - password check
    - generate access and refresh token
      - make separate method it takes userId
      - find userid in db
      - call generate access and refresh token 
      - update refresh token in db.
      - user.save({validateBeforeSave:false})// no need to validate other fields like password.
      - return { refreshToken , accessToken }

    - send through cookies
      - design some options to send cookies
      options ={ 
        httpOnly:true, // 
        secure:true, // able to modify only in server.
        // cant modify from server 
      }
    - return response 
      - can send multiple cookies 


    - User --> mongoose object 
    - user --> available custome method like refresh-access-token


 *** Logout ***:
  * for logout 
  * clear cookies which is manage by server 
  * clear access  + refresh token 
  * To find user , but whers the users comes from 
      - need middleware 
          - define your own middleware ,  for logout 

**auth.middleware.js** :
-  what it does ?
 - It verifies user exist or not 
 - verifyjwt


after user login have to give some routes
verify login from auth middleware



## Authentication Flow Overview

```
Client ‚Üí Login ‚Üí Server ‚Üí (Access Token + Refresh Token) ‚Üí Client
Client ‚Üí Protected Route ‚Üí [Middleware verifies Access Token] ‚Üí Resource
Client ‚Üí Token Refresh ‚Üí [Middleware verifies Refresh Token] ‚Üí New Tokens
```

## 1. Token Types and Their Roles

| Token Type | Purpose | Storage | Expiration |
|------------|---------|---------|------------|
| **Access Token** | Authentication & Authorization | Client Memory (Not localStorage) | Short (15 min - 1 hour) |
| **Refresh Token** | Generate new Access Tokens | HTTP-only Cookie + Database | Long (7 days - 1 month) |

## 2. User Model with Token Methods

**models/user.model.js**
```javascript
import mongoose from 'mongoose';
import bcrypt from 'bcrypt';
import jwt from 'jsonwebtoken';

const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema(
  {
    username: {
      type: String,
      required: true,
      unique: true,
      lowercase: true,
      trim: true,
      index: true
    },
    email: {
      type: String,
      required: true,
      unique: true,
      lowercase: true,
      trim: true
    },
    fullName: {
      type: String,
      required: true,
      trim: true,
      index: true
    },
    avatar: {
      type: String,
      required: true
    },
    coverImage: {
      type: String
    },
    password: {
      type: String,
      required: [true, 'Password is required']
    },
    refreshToken: {
      type: String
    },
    watchHistory: [
      {
        type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
        ref: "Video"
      }
    ]
  },
  { timestamps: true }
);

// Password hashing middleware
userSchema.pre('save', async function (next) {
  if (!this.isModified('password')) return next();
  this.password = await bcrypt.hash(this.password, 10);
  next();
});

// Password comparison method
userSchema.methods.isPasswordCorrect = async function (password) {
  return await bcrypt.compare(password, this.password);
};

// Generate access token method
userSchema.methods.generateAccessToken = function () {
  return jwt.sign(
    {
      _id: this._id,
      email: this.email,
      username: this.username,
      fullName: this.fullName
    },
    process.env.ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET,
    {
      expiresIn: process.env.ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRY || '1h'
    }
  );
};

// Generate refresh token method
userSchema.methods.generateRefreshToken = function () {
  return jwt.sign(
    {
      _id: this._id
    },
    process.env.REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET,
    {
      expiresIn: process.env.REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRY || '10d'
    }
  );
};

export const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);
```

## 3. Login Controller

**controllers/user.controller.js**
```javascript
import asyncHandler from "../middleware/asyncHandler.js";
import { User } from "../models/user.model.js";
import { ApiResponse } from "../utils/ApiResponse.js";
import { ApiError } from "../utils/ApiError.js";

const generateAccessAndRefreshTokens = async (userId) => {
  try {
    const user = await User.findById(userId);
    const accessToken = user.generateAccessToken();
    const refreshToken = user.generateRefreshToken();

    // Save refresh token to database
    user.refreshToken = refreshToken;
    await user.save({ validateBeforeSave: false }); // Skip validation for password

    return { accessToken, refreshToken };
  } catch (error) {
    throw new ApiError(500, "Something went wrong while generating tokens");
  }
};

const loginUser = asyncHandler(async (req, res) => {
  const { email, username, password } = req.body;

  // Check if username or email is provided
  if (!username && !email) {
    throw new ApiError(400, "Username or email is required");
  }

  // Find the user
  const user = await User.findOne({
    $or: [{ username }, { email }]
  });

  if (!user) {
    throw new ApiError(404, "User does not exist");
  }

  // Check password
  const isPasswordValid = await user.isPasswordCorrect(password);
  if (!isPasswordValid) {
    throw new ApiError(401, "Invalid user credentials");
  }

  // Generate tokens
  const { accessToken, refreshToken } = await generateAccessAndRefreshTokens(user._id);

  // Get user details without password and refresh token
  const loggedInUser = await User.findById(user._id).select("-password -refreshToken");

  // Cookie options
  const options = {
    httpOnly: true,
    secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === "production",
    sameSite: "strict"
  };

  // Send tokens in cookies and response
  return res
    .status(200)
    .cookie("accessToken", accessToken, options)
    .cookie("refreshToken", refreshToken, options)
    .json(
      new ApiResponse(
        200,
        {
          user: loggedInUser,
          accessToken,
          refreshToken
        },
        "User logged in successfully"
      )
    );
});

export { loginUser };
```

## 4. Authentication Middleware

**middleware/auth.middleware.js**
```javascript
import jwt from "jsonwebtoken";
import { ApiError } from "../utils/ApiError.js";
import asyncHandler from "./asyncHandler.js";
import { User } from "../models/user.model.js";

export const verifyJWT = asyncHandler(async (req, res, next) => {
  try {
    // Get token from cookies or Authorization header
    const token = req.cookies?.accessToken || req.header("Authorization")?.replace("Bearer ", "");
    
    if (!token) {
      throw new ApiError(401, "Unauthorized request");
    }

    // Verify token
    const decodedToken = jwt.verify(token, process.env.ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET);
    
    // Find user and check if token is valid
    const user = await User.findById(decodedToken?._id).select("-password -refreshToken");
    
    if (!user) {
      throw new ApiError(401, "Invalid access token");
    }

    // Attach user to request object
    req.user = user;
    next();
  } catch (error) {
    throw new ApiError(401, error?.message || "Invalid access token");
  }
});
```

## 5. Refresh Token Controller

**controllers/user.controller.js** (additional method)
```javascript
const refreshAccessToken = asyncHandler(async (req, res) => {
  const incomingRefreshToken = req.cookies.refreshToken || req.body.refreshToken;

  if (!incomingRefreshToken) {
    throw new ApiError(401, "Unauthorized request");
  }

  try {
    // Verify refresh token
    const decodedToken = jwt.verify(
      incomingRefreshToken,
      process.env.REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET
    );

    // Find user by decoded token ID
    const user = await User.findById(decodedToken?._id);

    if (!user) {
      throw new ApiError(401, "Invalid refresh token");
    }

    // Check if refresh token matches
    if (incomingRefreshToken !== user?.refreshToken) {
      throw new ApiError(401, "Refresh token is expired or used");
    }

    // Generate new tokens
    const { accessToken, refreshToken: newRefreshToken } = await generateAccessAndRefreshTokens(user._id);

    // Cookie options
    const options = {
      httpOnly: true,
      secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === "production",
    };

    // Send new tokens
    return res
      .status(200)
      .cookie("accessToken", accessToken, options)
      .cookie("refreshToken", newRefreshToken, options)
      .json(
        new ApiResponse(
          200,
          { accessToken, refreshToken: newRefreshToken },
          "Access token refreshed"
        )
      );
  } catch (error) {
    throw new ApiError(401, error?.message || "Invalid refresh token");
  }
});
```

## 6. Logout Controller

**controllers/user.controller.js** (additional method)
```javascript
const logoutUser = asyncHandler(async (req, res) => {
  // Remove refresh token from database
  await User.findByIdAndUpdate(
    req.user._id,
    {
      $set: {
        refreshToken: undefined
      }
    },
    {
      new: true
    }
  );

  // Cookie options for clearing
  const options = {
    httpOnly: true,
    secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === "production",
  };

  // Clear cookies and send response
  return res
    .status(200)
    .clearCookie("accessToken", options)
    .clearCookie("refreshToken", options)
    .json(new ApiResponse(200, {}, "User logged out"));
});
```

## 7. Route Implementation

**routes/user.routes.js**
```javascript
import express from 'express';
import { 
  loginUser, 
  logoutUser, 
  refreshAccessToken 
} from '../controllers/user.controller.js';
import { verifyJWT } from '../middleware/auth.middleware.js';

const router = express.Router();

router.route("/login").post(loginUser);

// Secured routes
router.route("/logout").post(verifyJWT, logoutUser);
router.route("/refresh-token").post(refreshAccessToken);

export default router;
```

## 8. Environment Variables

**.env**
```env
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=your-super-secret-access-token-key-here
REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET=your-super-secret-refresh-token-key-here
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRY=1h
REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRY=10d
```

## Missing/Incorrect Information in Original Request

1. **Token Storage**: The original mentioned storing refresh token on both client and server, but the correct approach is:
   - Access Token: Client memory (not localStorage for security )
   - Refresh Token: HTTP-only cookie + database

2. **Middleware Purpose**: The auth middleware should:
   - Extract and verify JWT tokens
   - Attach user information to the request object
   - Handle token expiration errors gracefully

3. **Logout Implementation**: Logout should:
   - Remove refresh token from database
   - Clear both access and refresh token cookies

4. **Token Generation**: Should be implemented as instance methods on the User model for better organization

5. **Error Handling**: Proper error handling was missing in the original description

  # Access token and refresh token in Backend

## **Token System Overview**
- Modern web authentication uses two tokens: **access token** and **refresh token**
- Both tokens work together to balance **security** and **user experience**

## **Access Token Characteristics**
- Short-lived token (typically 15 minutes to 1 hour)
- Grants immediate access to protected resources
- Short expiration limits vulnerability window if compromised
- Server rejects expired tokens with **401 Unauthorized** error

## **Refresh Token Characteristics**
- Longer-lived token (typically days or weeks)
- Acts as persistent session identifier
- Stored securely in database
- Used to obtain new access tokens without reauthentication

## **Token Expiration Flow**
1. User attempts to access protected resource with expired access token
2. Server responds with **401 Unauthorized** status
3. Frontend automatically detects token expiration
4. Frontend sends refresh token to dedicated refresh endpoint
5. Server verifies refresh token against database storage
6. If valid: server issues new access token (and often new refresh token)
7. If invalid: user must complete full login again
8. User session continues seamlessly without manual intervention

## **Security Implementation**
- Refresh tokens stored securely in database
- Token rotation: issuing new refresh tokens with each access token refresh
- JWT verification used to validate token authenticity
- Dedicated refresh endpoint in API routes
- Controller handles token validation and reissuance

## **Benefits**
- Enhanced security through short-lived access tokens
- Improved user experience by minimizing login interruptions
- Reduced password exposure through limited authentication requests
- Controlled session management through database-persisted refresh tokens

This token-based authentication system provides a robust security framework while maintaining a seamless user experience across browsing sessions.

---
  access token is expired : 
  - user want access some resource, but user get 401 request , behalf of login again , frontend dev inject some extra code which hit endpoint request to refresh token by sending refreshtoken,
  if refreshtoken from user side and db is valid and same, then restart session


  refreshToken known as session storage also store in db,

  **Logic**
  - make  endpoint for user to refresh their token 
  - user receives encrypted token 
  - we want raw token,to  verify it use jwtverify

  - write controller 
  - make endpoints in user.routes

  # hashnode 
  make an article refresh-token vs access-token

  ## Writing update controllers for user | Backend with JS

subscription Model
   - subscriber === user
   - channel === user
  
   - subscriber :  want to add multiple object




***Write separate controller for update files.  (better approach)***
- user want to update img only, gives img to update, save hit endpoint
- if we save whole user again then other fields override again 
- helps to reduce congestion 

 **controllers**
 - update user info
   - jwt to get user from routes

 - update files
  - In routes middlewares 
     1. auth
     2. multer
  - controllers

## write logic for  watch history 
watch history get ids of videos 

***how get data from other model ?***

In Subscription Model :
- from user profile 
- send subscriber counts
---
## Subscription Schema
*** how the schema is working ?***
  Subscription :
   - subscribers
   - channel

schema document , how many times its created
    User :-->  a,b,c,d,e
    channel : --> CAC, HCC, FCC

  DOCS have store 2 val for new doc 
  - a can subs multiple channel .
  - CAC have multiple users

  Q1. how to get subs of CAC
  if u want to subs of channel
    select those docs which contain CAC [count how many docs have CAC channel]
    - for subscribers :--> find docs contain same channel.or select * from subscription where channel == CAC;

  Q2. how to get channel for user [user subscribed to howmany channels.]
   - in schema select documents which contain user == c;


 /**
     coverImage, username, profileImage/avatar, fullname
     1. user subscribed to how many chnnels --> 202 subscribed
     2. how many user is subscribed to this channel-->  600k subscribers.
     not stored
  
     */
     ways :
      1. create subscribers array & add every user in array , it becomes expensive  if data is huge 
      2. create a model to store subscribers, channels
    finally need to perform join operation 

    need to understand 
    1. what is data is
    2. how to get this data 

    
# Subscription System Logic Explained

## **Core Concept: Self-Referential Many-to-Many Relationship**

### **What is the Subscription Model?**
The subscription system creates a relationship where:
- **Users can subscribe to other Users** (who become "channels")
- **Users can have subscribers** (becoming "channels" themselves)
- This creates a **many-to-many relationship** within the same User model

### **How the Schema Works**
The Subscription schema acts as a **junction table** or **bridge table** that connects users to other users through subscriptions:

```
Subscription Document Structure:
- subscriber: User ID (who is doing the subscribing)
- channel: User ID (who is being subscribed to)
- createdAt: Timestamp of when subscription was created
```

### **Real-World Example with Users**
Let's say we have 5 users: A, B, C, D, E and 3 channels: CAC, HCC, FCC

**Subscription Documents Created:**
1. User A subscribes to channel CAC ‚Üí Document: {subscriber: A, channel: CAC}
2. User A subscribes to channel HCC ‚Üí Document: {subscriber: A, channel: HCC}
3. User B subscribes to channel CAC ‚Üí Document: {subscriber: B, channel: CAC}
4. User C subscribes to channel FCC ‚Üí Document: {subscriber: C, channel: FCC}
5. User D subscribes to channel CAC ‚Üí Document: {subscriber: D, channel: CAC}

**Total Documents Created:** 5 (one for each subscription relationship)

## **Answering Your Questions**

### **Q1: How to Get Subscribers of CAC Channel?**
To find all subscribers of channel CAC:
- **Query**: Find all Subscription documents where `channel = CAC`
- **Result**: You'll get documents where subscribers are A, B, D
- **Count**: 3 subscribers (A, B, D)

**Process:**
1. Search the Subscription collection
2. Filter documents where channel field equals CAC's ID
3. Extract the subscriber IDs from these documents
4. Count how many documents were found = subscriber count

### **Q2: How to Get Channels User A is Subscribed To?**
To find all channels that user A subscribes to:
- **Query**: Find all Subscription documents where `subscriber = A`
- **Result**: You'll get documents where channels are CAC, HCC
- **Count**: 2 channels (CAC, HCC)

**Process:**
1. Search the Subscription collection
2. Filter documents where subscriber field equals A's ID
3. Extract the channel IDs from these documents
4. Count how many documents were found = subscription count

## **Why This Approach is Efficient**

### **Comparison with Alternative Approaches**

**Option 1: Array Storage (Inefficient)**
- Store subscriber arrays directly in User documents
- **Problem**: If a channel has millions of subscribers, the document becomes huge
- **Performance**: Slow to update, difficult to query, document size limits

**Option 2: Separate Subscription Model (Efficient) - Recommended**
- Store each subscription as a separate document
- **Advantages**:
  - Scalable to millions of subscriptions
  - Fast queries using indexes
  - No document size limitations
  - Easy to add metadata (subscription date, etc.)

### **How Data Retrieval Works**

**To get subscriber count for channel CAC:**
- Simple count query on Subscription collection
- Database uses index on channel field for fast results

**To get subscription count for user A:**
- Simple count query on Subscription collection
- Database uses index on subscriber field for fast results

**To get actual subscriber list with user details:**
1. Find all Subscription documents for the channel
2. Use population to get full user details for each subscriber
3. Return the combined data

## **Practical Implementation Logic**

### **Frontend Display Data**
When showing a user profile, you typically display:
1. **Subscription Count**: How many channels this user subscribes to
   - Query: Count documents where `subscriber = current-user-id`
   
2. **Subscriber Count**: How many users subscribe to this channel
   - Query: Count documents where `channel = profile-user-id`

### **Performance Considerations**
- Create database indexes on both `subscriber` and `channel` fields
- This makes count queries extremely fast even with millions of subscriptions
- The Subscription collection grows linearly with number of subscriptions
- Each subscription is a small document (only two references + timestamp)

### **Additional Features Enabled**
- **Subscription date**: Easy to show "Subscribed since [date]"
- **Subscription analytics**: Track growth over time
- **Easy unsubscription**: Simply delete the subscription document
- **Duplicate prevention**: Unique index on subscriber+channel combination

This approach provides a scalable, efficient way to manage subscriptions between users while maintaining fast query performance regardless of how large the platform grows.

# MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline: Complete Guide with $lookup (Left Join)

## **What is the Aggregation Pipeline?**

The aggregation pipeline is a framework for data processing in MongoDB that consists of one or more **stages** that process documents. Each stage performs a specific operation on the input documents, and the output from one stage is passed as input to the next stage.

## **Pipeline Structure**

```javascript
db.collection.aggregate([
  { $stage1: { ... } },   // Stage 1
  { $stage2: { ... } },   // Stage 2
  { $stage3: { ... } },   // Stage 3
  // ... more stages
])
```

## **Key Aggregation Stages**

### **1. $match Stage - Filter Documents**
Filters documents to pass only those that match the specified condition(s).

```javascript
{ 
  $match: { 
    field: value,
    anotherField: { $operator: value }
  } 
}
```

**Example:**
```javascript
// Filter orders with medium size
{ $match: { size: "medium" } }
```

### **2. $lookup Stage - Perform Left Join**
Performs a left outer join to another collection in the same database.

```javascript
{
  $lookup: {
    from: "target_collection",      // Collection to join with
    localField: "field_from_input", // Field from input documents
    foreignField: "field_from_target", // Field from documents in "from" collection
    as: "output_array_field"        // Name of the output array field
  }
}
```

### **3. $unwind Stage - Deconstruct Array**
Deconstructs an array field from the input documents to output a document for each element.

```javascript
{ 
  $unwind: {
    path: "$array_field",
    preserveNullAndEmptyArrays: true // Optional: keep docs with missing/empty arrays
  } 
}
```

### **4. $addFields / $set Stage - Add New Fields**
Adds new fields to documents or replaces existing fields.

```javascript
{ 
  $addFields: {
    newField: expression,
    existingField: newValue
  } 
}
```

### **5. $project Stage - Reshape Documents**
Controls the output document structure (include, exclude, reshape fields).

```javascript
{ 
  $project: {
    fieldToInclude: 1,
    fieldToExclude: 0,
    computedField: expression
  } 
}
```

### **6. $group Stage - Group Documents**
Groups documents by specified identifier and applies accumulator expressions.

```javascript
{ 
  $group: {
    _id: "$groupByField",     // Group by this field
    total: { $sum: "$amount" }, // Accumulator expressions
    count: { $sum: 1 },
    average: { $avg: "$price" }
  } 
}
```

### **7. $sort Stage - Sort Documents**
Sorts all input documents and returns them in sorted order.

```javascript
{ 
  $sort: { 
    field1: 1,   // 1 = ascending, -1 = descending
    field2: -1 
  } 
}
```

## **Complete $lookup Example with User-Subscription Join**

### **Scenario: Get Users with Their Subscription Details**

```javascript
db.users.aggregate([
  // Stage 1: Filter active users
  {
    $match: {
      status: "active"
    }
  },
  
  // Stage 2: Join with subscriptions collection (Left Join)
  {
    $lookup: {
      from: "subscriptions",      // Join with subscriptions collection
      localField: "_id",          // User's _id field
      foreignField: "subscriber", // subscriber field in subscriptions
      as: "subscription_details"  // Output array field name
    }
  },
  
  // Stage 3: Convert array to object (optional)
  {
    $addFields: {
      subscription_details: {
        $arrayElemAt: ["$subscription_details", 0] // Get first element or null
      }
    }
  },
  
  // Stage 4: Project only needed fields
  {
    $project: {
      username: 1,
      email: 1,
      "subscription_details.channel": 1,
      "subscription_details.subscribedAt": 1
    }
  }
])
```

## **Advanced $lookup with Multiple Joins**

```javascript
db.users.aggregate([
  // Join with subscriptions
  {
    $lookup: {
      from: "subscriptions",
      localField: "_id",
      foreignField: "subscriber",
      as: "user_subscriptions"
    }
  },
  
  // Join with channels (through subscriptions)
  {
    $lookup: {
      from: "users",              // Channels are also users
      localField: "user_subscriptions.channel",
      foreignField: "_id",
      as: "subscribed_channels"
    }
  },
  
  // Add channel count
  {
    $addFields: {
      subscription_count: {
        $size: "$user_subscriptions"
      }
    }
  },
  
  // Project final output
  {
    $project: {
      username: 1,
      email: 1,
      subscription_count: 1,
      subscribed_channels: {
        username: 1,
        fullName: 1
      }
    }
  }
])
```

## **Common Aggregation Patterns**

### **Pattern 1: Count Subscriptions per User**
```javascript
db.subscriptions.aggregate([
  // Group by subscriber and count subscriptions
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "$subscriber",
      subscription_count: { $sum: 1 },
      subscribed_channels: { $push: "$channel" }
    }
  },
  
  // Join with users to get user details
  {
    $lookup: {
      from: "users",
      localField: "_id",
      foreignField: "_id",
      as: "user_details"
    }
  },
  
  // Format output
  {
    $project: {
      user: { $arrayElemAt: ["$user_details", 0] },
      subscription_count: 1,
      subscribed_channels: 1
    }
  }
])
```

### **Pattern 2: Get Channel with Subscriber Count**
```javascript
db.subscriptions.aggregate([
  // Filter if needed
  { $match: { status: "active" } },
  
  // Group by channel and count subscribers
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "$channel",
      subscriber_count: { $sum: 1 },
      subscriber_list: { $push: "$subscriber" }
    }
  },
  
  // Join with users (channels)
  {
    $lookup: {
      from: "users",
      localField: "_id",
      foreignField: "_id",
      as: "channel_details"
    }
  },
  
  // Final projection
  {
    $project: {
      channel: { $arrayElemAt: ["$channel_details", 0] },
      subscriber_count: 1
    }
  }
])
```

## **Important Notes**

1. **Field References**: Always use `$` prefix when referring to document fields
2. **Execution Order**: Stages execute sequentially from top to bottom
3. **Performance**: Use `$match` early to reduce documents processed in later stages
4. **Indexes**: Ensure proper indexes on fields used in `$match`, `$lookup`, and `$group`
5. **Memory**: Be cautious with large datasets that might exceed memory limits

## **Syntax Summary**

| Operation | Syntax | Purpose |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| **Field Reference** | `$fieldName` | Reference a document field |
| **Variable** | `$$VARIABLE` | Reference a variable |
| **Literal** | `"value"` | Use a literal value |
| **Expression** | `{ $operator: value }` | Use aggregation expression |

This aggregation framework provides powerful data processing capabilities similar to SQL joins and transformations, but with MongoDB's document-oriented approach.

## profile
to channel profile we typed in search url
- req.params (from url)
- validate user
- from document find user
- User.find({username}) or use match
- aggregrate a method that takes array from which write pipeline
- The values comes after aggregate pipeline is in array.


## How to write sub pipelines and routes

## postman test   
post : refresh-token 
post : change-password :: need to send json data
